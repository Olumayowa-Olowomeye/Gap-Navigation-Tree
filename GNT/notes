homotopy/homeorphism strength on I graph
can we recognize that 2 shapes are in the same equivalence homotopy class?
graph isomorphism class


1. generate positive and negative examples
2. 

look at foilation of manifolds*
canonical shape I made of squares
family of functions that continously change the shape of the squares


knot theory but with gnt?
Reidemeister moves
Bresenham's line algorithm for lidar

1. here is a gnt and generate an environment:
    if this is the case then every tree we want should have a gnt

Current to do by 1/18/21
x implement Bresenham's line algorithm for lidar  
- implement chase gap
- implement CE handler
