homotopy/homeorphism strength on I graph
can we recognize that 2 shapes are in the same equivalence homotopy class?
graph isomorphism class


1. generate positive and negative examples
2. 

look at foilation of manifolds*
canonical shape I made of squares
family of functions that continously change the shape of the squares
